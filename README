About

This program is a DVI viewer. It uses dvipdfmx to convert a DVI file to PDF, thus allowing the text in the document to be searched or selected, unlike with conventional viewers.


Compilation
===========

To compile the program, you need to install certain packages required by the WebView2 control used by DVIVue. Please follow the instruction in 'Step 2 - Install WebView2 SDK' substeps 2 and 3 here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/gettingstarted/win32
